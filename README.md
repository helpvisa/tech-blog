## Installation

Navigate to the root directory of the project in your commandline and type 'npm i' in order to install the packages necessary to run the project. If you're running your database locally, it's a good idea to also use the MySQL CLI to initialize the schema.sql file in the db folder.


## Usage

Navigate to the root directory of the project in your commandline and type 'npm start' in order to start your server. Make sure you've created a .env file using the included .env.example as a baseline.
